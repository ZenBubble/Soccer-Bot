THis was a project I made for a robot car using a simple ESP32 and a L298N servo controller. When ESP is active, it creates a web server either directly or through the local wifi depending on which setting usedirect is on. The webpage has a slider that
can be sued to adjust the servo speed and utilizes tank controls. Instructions for custom libraries are found in the arduino file.
